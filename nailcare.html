                Nail care can be broken down into several easy steps. The most important things to remember when caring for your nails is to keep them hydrated, not to use your nails as tools and to keep them polished whenever possible.

                My basic nail routine consists of oiling my nails to moisturize them before using 100% acetone to remove the last week's manicure. After drying my nails, I use a liquid cuticle remover and my cuticle pusher to gently push my cuticles back while removing any dead skin from around my nails. Once I wipe off the last of the cuticle remover, I dip my nails in the acetone again to amke sure they are dry which helps in making my manicure last longer. Once, I've wiped the ace4tone off, I'm ready to get to the fun part: painting my nails!

                Moisturizing your nails is very important and easy to do. Most nail polish companies sell some form of nail oil or balm that you can apply to your nails and cuticles to keep them moisturized which will also help your manicure last longer. You just want to make sure your nail oil or balm contains jojoba oil. Jojoba oil is very moisturizing.

                Keeping your nails polished and not using them as tools are two other key aspects to taking care of your nails. Keeping your nails polished as much as possible helps keep your nails from breaking and cracking. Also not using your nails as tools such as opening a can of soda will also help care for your nails. I find it most useful to use the sides of my fingers in times I would use my nails as tools.
